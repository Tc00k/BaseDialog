## Introduction

BaseDialog is an easily adaptable script that, at default, launches one dialog window with the capability to launch a second by changing a simple flag. These windows are easily adjustable and able to display any information you would need them to using SwiftDialog, I typically use this script as a starting point for all my other more complicated SwiftDialog scripts.
